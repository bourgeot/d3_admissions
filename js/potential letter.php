To the members of the search committee:

I am excited to submit my application for JOB. The direction the CIO’s office is moving is very encouraging to me. I believe the federated model of IT support shows a lot of promise for thei institution. Moving that forward with this level of a position adds significantly to its chances of success over the longer term, and I would very much like to play a role in that.
