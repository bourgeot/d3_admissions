To the Members of the Search Committee:

I present to you my application for the position of Executive Director of UITS which has recently been advertised. While is no secret that I have been an outspoken critic of UITS, the fact of this has led me to 'put my money where my mouth is' and offer to bear some risk to become part of a solution to improve it. I would like to take the opportunity below to briefly describe my take on UITS, and how it can become a more able and more widely respected participant in the broader campus information technology landscape. Because this is an application letter, in this context I'll also remark on how my qualifications will contribute to the success of this approach.

I serve currently as the Executive Director of Student Affairs Information Systems in the division of Student Affairs. I this capacity I oversee the direction and operations of the Student Affairs Systems Group.
